There is a initial Home Screen outputting a welcome message

there will be a prompt for, which user can input to enter dataset detail screen

Then would prompt user whether they would like to see mean of all captured samples
        If yes, the mean would be outputted
        Within this screen there will be a function to exit this screen to return to dataset detail screen

if no user would be prompt whether they would like to search a specific category

    If category name inputted correctly, would output category details via reading csv file

    Again user would be prompt whether they would like to see the mean number of captured samples

    However, another function is implemented that would allow the user to search a serial number and it would extract that row with the corresponding serial number 
    E.G - SR. No - 1
        Family - dowgin
        Number of Samples - 26970
